Description: This repository contains a modern web-based implementation (v2.0) for determining the Blood Lactate Threshold (LTH). 
The software utilizes advanced polynomial regression models to analyze lactate response to exercise, providing athletes, coaches, and sports scientists with a precise statistical tool for performance optimization.

Key Features: Calculates inverse regresion equation and LTH using polynominal regression models.

Core Engine: Based on the renowned PolySolve algorithm by Paul Lutus.

Transition: A web-optimized evolution of the original v1.0 Visual Basic 6 desktop application.

Methodology: Implements linear, logarithmic, and high-order polynomial models to identify the lactate threshold (e.g., at 4 mmol/L or individual anaerobic threshold).

Zero Installation: Fully functional in any modern web browser via JavaScript/HTML5.

Academic Reference: This work is based on the research presented in: Irmak, R., et al. (2012). "Computer Software for Statistically Determined Blood Lactate Threshold for Sport Physiotherapists and Sport Trainers."

Live Demo: You can access the live version of this software in both Turkish and English at: 👉 rafetirmak.com
